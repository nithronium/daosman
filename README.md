## Welcome to daosman. 

This is a personal project where I am to explore what 
we can do with DAOs. Initially I was planning to go big 
however I have realized that it is better to code a mini 
DAO first and see the possibilities of this technology.

So I have came up with the daosman (my name is Osman, so, why not?)
and I'll be coding a mini dao and will be expanding its functionality 
further with the support of sub-daos as well as on chain 
identification protocol. 

Feel free to open issues if you'll see any problem on the 
codes I wrote or PR for adding new features. I might not be 
able to review issues & PRs so often as I work full time 
for the Omlira project already.
