##Â Governance of the daosman

The governance of the daosman is aimed to be fully decentralized.

For that reason I have created a conventions folder, and wrote my 
initial conventions there, each convention's SHA256 fingerprint 
will be registered via the daosman and later be voted by the community.

If a convention is set to be accepted, then people will follow that convention
(I hope)

Please add your drafts to "drafts" folder and register them on the dao
if you would like others to vote for it.
